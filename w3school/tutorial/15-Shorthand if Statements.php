<!-- PHP Shorthand if Statements
Short Hand If

To write shorter code, you can write if statements on one line.
Example
Get your own PHP Server

One-line if statement: -->
<?php
$a = 5;

if ($a < 10) $b = "Hello";

echo $b
?>
<!-- Short Hand If...Else

if...else statements can also be written in one line, but the syntax is a bit different.
Example

One-line if...else statement: -->
<?php
$a = 13;

$b = $a < 10 ? "Hello" : "Good Bye";

echo $b;
?>
<!-- This technique is known as Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions. -->
