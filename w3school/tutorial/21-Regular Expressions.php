<!-- PHP Regular Expressions
What is a Regular Expression?

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.

Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.
Syntax

In PHP, regular expressions are strings composed of delimiters, a pattern and optional modifiers.

$exp = "/w3schools/i";

In the example above, / is the delimiter, w3schools is the pattern that is being searched for, and i is a modifier that makes the search case-insensitive.

The delimiter can be any character that is not a letter, number, backslash or space. The most common delimiter is the forward slash (/), but when your pattern contains forward slashes it is convenient to choose other delimiters such as # or ~.
Regular Expression Functions

PHP provides a variety of functions that allow you to use regular expressions.

The most common functions are:
Function 	Description
preg_match() 	Returns 1 if the pattern was found in the string and 0 if not
preg_match_all() 	Returns the number of times the pattern was found in the string, which may also be 0
preg_replace() 	Returns a new string where matched patterns have been replaced with another string
Using preg_match()

The preg_match() function will tell you whether a string contains matches of a pattern.
Example
Get your own PHP Server

Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive search for "w3schools" in a string: -->
<?php
$str = "Visit W3Schools";
$pattern = "/w3schools/i";
echo preg_match($pattern, $str);
?>
<!-- Using preg_match_all()

The preg_match_all() function will tell you how many matches were found for a pattern in a string.
Example

Use a regular expression to do a case-insensitive count of the number of occurrences of "ain" in a string: -->
<?php
$str = "The rain in SPAIN falls mainly on the plains.";
$pattern = "/ain/i";
echo preg_match_all($pattern, $str);
?>
<!-- Using preg_replace()

The preg_replace() function will replace all of the matches of the pattern in a string with another string.
Example

Use a case-insensitive regular expression to replace Microsoft with W3Schools in a string: -->
<?php
$str = "Visit Microsoft!";
$pattern = "/microsoft/i";
echo preg_replace($pattern, "W3Schools", $str);
?>

Regular Expression Modifiers

Modifiers can change how a search is performed.
Modifier 	Description 	Try it
i 	Performs a case-insensitive search 	
m 	Performs a multiline search (patterns that search for a match at the beginning or end of a string will now match the beginning or end of each line) 	
u 	Enables correct matching of UTF-8 encoded patterns 	
Regular Expression Patterns

Brackets are used to find a range of characters:
Expression 	Description 	Try it
[abc] 	Find one or many of the characters inside the brackets 	
[^abc] 	Find any character NOT between the brackets 	
[a-z] 	Find any character alphabetically between two letters 	
[A-z] 	Find any character alphabetically between a specified upper-case letter and a specified lower-case letter 	
[A-Z] 	Find any character alphabetically between two upper-case letters. 	
[123] 	Find one or many of the digits inside the brackets 	
[0-5] 	Find any digits between the two numbers 	
[0-9] 	Find any digits 	
Metacharacters

Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:
Metacharacter 	Description 	Try it
| 	Find a match for any one of the patterns separated by | as in: cat|dog|fish 	
. 	Find any character 	
^ 	Finds a match as the beginning of a string as in: ^Hello 	
$ 	Finds a match at the end of the string as in: World$ 	
\d 	Find any digits 	
\D 	Find any non-digits 	
\s 	Find any whitespace character 	
\S 	Find any non-whitespace character 	
\w 	Find any alphabetical letter (a to Z) and digit (0 to 9) 	
\W 	Find any non-alphabetical and non-digit character 	
\b 	Find a match at the beginning of a word like this: \bWORD, or at the end of a word like this: WORD\b 	
\uxxxx 	Find the Unicode character specified by the hexadecimal number xxxx 	
Quantifiers

Quantifiers define quantities:
Quantifier 	Description 	Try it
n+ 	Matches any string that contains at least one n 	
n* 	Matches any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n 	
n? 	Matches any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n 	
n{3} 	Matches any string that contains a sequence of 3 n's 	
n{2, 5} 	Matches any string that contains a sequence of at least 2, but not more that 5 n's 	
n{3,} 	Matches any string that contains a sequence of at least 3 n's 	

Note: If your expression needs to search for one of the special characters you can use a backslash ( \ ) to escape them. For example, to search for one or more question marks you can use the following expression: $pattern = '/\?+/';
Grouping

You can use parentheses ( ) to apply quantifiers to entire patterns. They also can be used to select parts of the pattern to be used as a match.
Example

Use grouping to search for the word "banana" by looking for ba followed by two instances of na: -->
<?php
$str = "Apples and bananas.";
$pattern = "/ba(na){2}/i";
echo preg_match($pattern, $str);
?>
