PHP Predefined Constants

PHP has nine predefined constants that change value depending on where they are used, and therefor they are called "magic constants".

These magic constants are written with a double underscore at the start and the end, except for the ClassName::class constant.
Magic Constants

Here are the magic constants, with descriptions and examples:
Constant 	Description 	
__CLASS__ 	If used inside a class, the class name is returned. 	
__DIR__ 	The directory of the file. 	
__FILE__ 	The file name including the full path. 	
__FUNCTION__ 	If inside a function, the function name is returned. 	
__LINE__ 	The current line number. 	
__METHOD__ 	If used inside a function that belongs to a class, both class and function name is returned. 	
__NAMESPACE__ 	If used inside a namespace, the name of the namespace is returned. 	
__TRAIT__ 	If used inside a trait, the trait name is returned. 	
ClassName::class 	Returns the name of the specified class and the name of the namespace, if any. 	

Note:

The magic constants are case-insensitive, meaning __LINE__ returns the same as __line__.
